            To limit access to the full range of fields within the search form in order to maintain
            an overall faster search facility. By providing limited access to all our search fields, we
            are able to limit the impact on the performance of our search engine during periods of
            intense user activity. Whilst all users gain unhindered access to the key database fields,
            are limited to those users who register.

    <h3>Why we use cookies</h3>

    <p>Buildmate uses cookies for 3 purposes:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            To enable the delivery of functionality that improves the ease and speed of using the
            Buildmate web site (see above).
        </li>
        <li>
            To frequency cap display advertisements, particularly pop-up boxes. By limiting advertisement
            exposure we provide a more compelling user experience for site visitors and also ensure that
            advertisements on Buildmate are more evenly spread across our user base.
        </li>
        <li>
            To enable us to track the relative popularity of disparate parts of our site. This in
            turn enables us to concentrate our efforts on developing those parts of the site that are
            generating the greatest consumer demand.
        </li>
    </ol>
